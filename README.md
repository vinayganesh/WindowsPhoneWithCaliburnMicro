# WindowsPhoneWithCaliburnMicro

A Sample Windows Phone application using the Caliburn Micro framework. Its more like plug and play.

Steps to use it
1. Fork the repository
2. Create your ViewModel and Views
3. Create your Services.
4. Register ViewModel and Services info to App.xaml.cs
5. To change the Display root, change the DisplayRoot<> to any of the view you would like. 

All in all follow what is there in the View, ViewModel, Services, IServices folders of the application. There is dependency injection that is being used which really comes in handy.
